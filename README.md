This is a murder-mystery game. It was created for a competition, accounting for the odd format. The name comes from the fact it's a mystery.

## Archival Apology
I've tried to preserve the game mostly as I entered it into the Esolangs Code Guessing competition. In particular I've preserved my obfuscations to the code and aesthetics, which I made to prevent other competitors from figuring out who created this entry until the competition was over. I hope my way of archiving it does not detract from the user experience.

## Installation
Run `build.sh` to compile `game.shar`, if compile is the right word. Then run `game.shar` to start the game.
I previously said that if you have the skills to install the dependencies for `game.shar`, you probably have the tech skills needed to finish the game. If not, I said you should brush up on your Unix CLI utility skills, because you'll find them useful. However, some users may find it convenient to simply use the `Dockerfile` after running `build.sh`, which puts the user in an environment for playing the game.

During the competition I also released `shivers.eml` as a cryptic hint to players, who were going down the wrong track.

Kiran Patel is dead.
                     Find the murderer.
                                        Flash drive attached.

Hello Lars,


The higher-ups want the Kiran Patel case wrapped up quickly. Flaherty’s team is busy. I need you on it.

The deceased’s spouse, Krishna Patel, found the body in their shared home on the morning of the 2nd. There was no sign of a break in.

A USB flash drive was found on the body, which we believe was in Kiran Patel’s possession at time of death. Its contents are attached.

The coroner reports that the deceased died of blood loss, 36 to 48 hours before discovery. Krishna Patel claims to have been in the air during that interval, although we are still waiting for confirmation from the Cairo International Airport. Patel was stabbed three times in the back, no struggle.


Best of luck,
C.I. Said
